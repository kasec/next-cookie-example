# COOKIE EXAMPLE NEXTJS & EXPRESSJS

> Authorization strategy with express and nextjs using a token a cookies.

To run next app use `yarn dev`
To run API-REST use `node api.js`

I'm using a `pages/api` to create a cookie receiving a token from API-REST, but im lookin a way to send a cookie from API REST and get the value in page/view just in server side.
